# 📄**stakeholder Summary**

## *Milestone 4 – Stakeholder Summary*

**Project:** Gold Pathfinder ML – Shamkya Mining Project
**Program:** MIT Emerging Talent – ELO2
**Date:** 10 Nov 2025

---

## 🟡 Executive Summary

This phase of the project focused on **interpreting geochemical data** to identify where gold is most likely concentrated in the Shamkya area. By analyzing laboratory assays and applying geochemical vectoring techniques, the project reveals **clear mineralization patterns**, identifies a probable **core zone**, and highlights the most useful indicators for targeting future drilling.

The key outcome:
👉 **Gold is highly localized, but pathfinder elements—especially the Sb/As ratio—provide a reliable method to predict where higher grades occur.**

---

## 🥇 **Key Findings**

## 1. Gold Distribution Is Highly Localized

Gold grades show extreme variability, with most samples being very low but a few reaching high values (up to 100 ppm).
This indicates:

* Strong **nugget effect** (common in coarse-gold systems)
* Narrow, well-defined mineralized shoots
* High exploration uncertainty when relying on gold alone

This reinforces the need for **pathfinder-based** exploration.

---

## 2. Pathfinder Elements Reveal Clear Patterns

Our analysis shows:

* **Antimony (Sb)** has the strongest positive relationship with gold.
* **Silver (Ag)** also increases in mineralized zones.
* **Zinc (Zn)** tends to appear in more **distal** or less mineralized zones.

These relationships match classical theories of how hydrothermal systems form mineralization halos.

---

## 3. Sb/As Ratio Is a Strong Vectoring Tool

Since gold is variable, the **Sb/As ratio** provides a more stable indicator of mineralization.
We found that:

* Higher Sb/As ratios consistently occur near high-gold intervals
* The ratio increases toward the **core of the system**
* This pattern helps define **target zones** even where Au is low

This is one of the most important exploration insights for field teams.

---

## 4. Spatial Maps Define a Core–Transition–Distal Pattern

Using 2D contour maps, 3D surfaces, and clustering:

### **Core Zone**

* High gold values
* Elevated Sb/As
* Strong pathfinder response

### **Transition Zone**

* Moderate Sb, moderate gold
* Mixed geochemical signature

### **Distal Zone**

* Lower Au
* Higher Zn
* Weak pathfinder signature

These zones align with typical orogenic gold systems and support the interpretation.

---

## 5. Clear Visual Evidence Supports the Interpretation

The following figures (included in the repository) help stakeholders visualize the system:

* **2D Au contour map** → shows hotspot locations
* **3D Au surface** → highlights spikes in mineralization
* **Cluster map** → simplifies geochemical zoning
* **Sb/As vs Au plot** → demonstrates vectoring effectiveness

Interactive 3D HTML files allow deeper exploration during presentations.

---

## 🎯 **What This Means for Decision-Makers**

## ✔ Pathfinder ratios *can* reliably guide drilling

Especially **Sb/As**, which is far more stable than gold itself.

### ✔ Data supports focusing on the central–eastern zone

All evidence (spatial + geochemical + clustering) points to this area.

### ✔ Exploration should use gold + pathfinders together

Gold alone is not sufficient due to extreme nugget variability.

---

## ⚠️ **Limitations & Uncertainties**

* The dataset does **not** include mercury (Hg), limiting As/Hg ratio analysis.
* The nugget effect means individual gold assays may be misleading.
* Spatial coverage may not perfectly represent the entire system.

These factors should be communicated clearly to avoid over-confidence.

---

## 💡 **Recommended Next Steps**

1. **Use Sb/As ratio alongside gold grade** to prioritize drilling targets.
2. **Map the ratio spatially** to create a vectoring surface.
3. **Conduct targeted infill sampling** in the interpreted core zone.
4. Optionally, develop a simple **high-Au prediction model** using:

   * Sb
   * Ag
   * Bi
   * Zn
   * Sb/As
