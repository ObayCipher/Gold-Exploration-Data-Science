# Executive Summary – Gold Pathfinder ML Project

## Milestone 5 – Final Communication Artifact

### MIT Emerging Talent – ELO2

The Shamkya Mining Project dataset contains 1,754 samples with multi-element geochemistry and spatial coordinates. Due to the nugget effect, gold values show extreme variability and cannot be used alone for reliable targeting. This project applies data science and geochemical vectoring techniques to identify patterns that point toward mineralized centers.

Gold distribution analysis shows strong skewness with localized hotspots. 2D contours and 3D surfaces highlight a central–eastern anomaly. Antimony (Sb), silver (Ag), and bismuth (Bi) display the strongest positive correlations with gold, while zinc (Zn) is a reliable distal indicator.

Pathfinder ratios were engineered to improve vectoring. The Sb/As ratio correlates strongly with gold and exhibits spatial clustering near high-grade zones. K-means clustering (k=3) reveals three geochemical zones: a core high-Au/Sb zone, a transitional halo, and a distal Zn-rich background.

A conceptual composite index (As–Sb–Hg) demonstrates how multi-element signatures strengthen 3D targeting. Geological interpretation points to an orogenic gold system hosted in granitic gneiss and amphibolite, with fluid pathways controlled by shearing.

The final result is a reproducible, open-source exploration workflow that integrates geoscience with data science to reduce uncertainty and improve exploration efficiency.
