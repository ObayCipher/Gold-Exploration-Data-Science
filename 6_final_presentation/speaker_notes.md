# Milestone 5 – Speaker Notes

## Final Presentation – Gold Pathfinder ML Project

### MIT Emerging Talent – ELO2

## Slide 1 – Title

Hello everyone, my name is Obay Salih. This is my ELO2 final project presentation: a geochemically driven approach to identifying gold mineralization in the Shamkya Project. This work combines geology, data science, and visualization to support exploration decisions.

---

## Slide 2 – Exploration Challenge

Gold is highly variable due to the nugget effect — two nearby samples can have extremely different gold values. This means gold alone is not reliable for early-stage targeting. Pathfinder elements provide the stability needed for real insights.

---

## Slide 3 – Dataset

The project uses ALS assay data from cores, RC, trenches, chip and grab samples. After merging and cleaning, the final dataset contains 1,754 samples with Au, As, Sb, Ag, Bi, Zn and coordinates. This creates the foundation for geochemical analysis.

---

## Slide 4 – Gold Distribution

Gold shows extreme skew and localized hotspots. The 2D contour and 3D surface illustrate where major mineralized clusters occur. These visuals immediately show that mineralization is structurally focused.

---

## Slide 5 – Pathfinder Elements

Correlation analysis shows Sb has the strongest positive relationship with Au, followed by Ag and Bi. Zn correlates negatively and represents distal zones. This is consistent with orogenic gold system geochemistry.

---

## Slide 6 – Pathfinder Ratios

Sb/As ratio is an excellent vectoring tool and increases toward high-gold areas. Cu/Zn provides limited insight. The ratio scatterplot shows that high Sb/As aligns with top Au quartiles.

---

## Slide 7 – Clustering

K-means clustering identifies three distinct geochemical zones: a core high-Au zone, a transitional halo, and a distal Zn-rich zone. This validates the zonation predicted by geochemical theory.

---

## Slide 8 – Composite Index (3D)

A conceptual As–Sb–Hg index helps visualize how multi-element vectoring works in 3D. High index zones coincide strongly with gold hotspots.

---

## Slide 9 – Geological Interpretation

The system matches an orogenic gold deposit hosted in granitic gneiss and amphibolite. Alteration and pathfinder behavior support a deep hydrothermal origin, focused in shear zones.

---

## Slide 10 – Final Interpretation

Gold is highly localized. Sb/As ratio is the best vectoring tool. Cluster maps and 3D surfaces outline a clear mineralized corridor in the central–eastern area.

---

## Slide 11 – Impact

This workflow improves exploration efficiency, reduces uncertainty, and demonstrates how open-source tools can replace expensive proprietary mining software.

## Slide 12 – Thank You

Thank you for your attention. I am happy to answer any questions.
