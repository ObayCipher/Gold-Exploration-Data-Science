# Milestone 1 – Problem Identification

**Gold Pathfinder ML Project – MIT Emerging Talent (ELO2)**  
**Team:** Obay Salih · Salih Adam
**Date:** October 2025

## Domain Summary

Gold exploration suffers from high uncertainty due to nugget effect, coarse gold distribution, and limited early‑stage data. Pathfinder elements (As, Sb, Bi, Cu, Zn) help indicate mineralization halos.

## Problem Statement

How can Python‑based exploratory data analysis reveal geochemical patterns that indicate potential gold mineralization zones?

## Research Question

Which geochemical variables and ratios (e.g., Sb/As, Cu/Zn) best predict anomalous Au zones in the Shamkya project?

## Stakeholder Analysis

- Exploration geologists: want vectoring tools  
- Investors: want clarity + risk reduction  
- Data scientists: reproducible workflows  
- Community/Environment: transparency  

## Constraints

- Incomplete spatial metadata  
- Variable sample quality  
- Coarse-gold variance  
- Open‑source only  

## Literature Summary

Pathfinder behavior in orogenic systems; geochemical halos; vectoring via ratios; statistical approaches to nugget‑effect mitigation.

## Success Criteria

- Clear problem framing  
- Domain‑aligned research question  
- Feasible analytic plan for M2–M3
