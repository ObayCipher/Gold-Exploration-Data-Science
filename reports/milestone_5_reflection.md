# Milestone 5 Reflection – Final Presentation

## MIT Emerging Talent – ELO2

---

## What Went Well

- The final communication artifact clearly summarized the technical work completed in earlier milestones.
- Visual elements such as 2D contour, 3D gold surface, and clustering outputs strengthened the storytelling.
- The project successfully translated complex geochemical concepts into accessible visual narratives.

## What Was Challenging

- Selecting only a few visuals from a large analytical output required careful prioritization.
- Maintaining simplicity without losing geological accuracy was a balancing act.
- Preparing material for both technical and non-technical audiences required iteration.

## What I Learned

- Communication is as critical as analysis in data science.
- Effective storytelling transforms raw data into actionable insights.
- Visual analytics significantly improve geological interpretation and stakeholder engagement.

## What Will Improve Next Time

- Start building communication artifacts earlier in the process.
- Develop automated scripts for exporting figures in presentation-ready formats.
- Practice refining messages for different audience types.
