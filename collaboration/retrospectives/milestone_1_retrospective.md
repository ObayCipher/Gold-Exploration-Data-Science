# 🧠 Milestone 1 Retrospective — Problem Identification  

**Gold Pathfinder ML Project (MIT Emerging Talent — ELO2)**  
**Milestone Period:** Oct 1 – Oct 12, 2025

---

## ✅ What Went Well — Team Level

- The domain research phase helped us converge on a **clear, geoscientifically grounded problem** involving pathfinder elements and gold mineralization.
- We identified relevant **scientific papers**, case studies, and exploration methods, strengthening the academic foundation of the project.
- Meetings were productive, and both team members contributed to refining the problem statement and research questions.
- We successfully connected **geoscience knowledge** with **data science techniques**, such as PCA, correlation matrices, and anomaly detection.
- Decision-making was collaborative and efficient, enabling rapid progress within the milestone window.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges — Team Level

- Narrowing the project scope required careful balancing between **geological relevance** and **data science feasibility**.
- Some literature was highly technical, requiring extra time to interpret and summarize.
- Coordinating across time zones occasionally caused delays in reviewing documents and confirming decisions.
- Determining which ML methods are appropriate given the dataset size required additional discussion.

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- A strong domain study significantly improves the clarity and strength of the research question.
- Open-source data science tools can meaningfully support early-stage exploration — even when traditional geological software is unavailable.
- Access to high-quality scientific literature is essential for grounding assumptions and identifying realistic analytical workflows.
- Milestones benefit from **structured agendas** and documentation, which keep the project aligned.

---

## 🔄 Improvements for Next Milestone

- Improve asynchronous communication (GitHub issues, shared docs) to reduce delays.
- Assign clearer micro-roles during Milestone 2 (e.g., Obay leads cleaning, Salih leads documentation).
- Establish a lightweight workflow for summarizing papers as soon as they are added.
- Build in buffer time to verify the accuracy of ALS data conversions and transformations.

## 🎯 Strategy vs. Board

### What went as expected?

- We created a solid domain foundation and quickly aligned on gold pathfinder geochemistry.
- Early planning and delegation helped maintain steady progress.
- Documentation quality improved significantly from Milestone 0.

### What didn’t go as expected?

- The problem-scoping stage took longer due to the large number of possible analytical directions.
- Reviewing scientific literature consumed more time than planned.

### Strategy Changes  

- Added a shared paper-summary document for better knowledge management.
- Introduced asynchronous communication tools to improve coordination.

## **Obay Salih**

### 🧠 Personal Learnings

I learned how critical the domain study phase is for shaping a meaningful research question. Translating geological concepts into data science tasks was challenging but rewarding. Understanding how pathfinder elements relate to gold mineralization improved my confidence in designing an analytical workflow.

### ✅ Successes

My geological background helped guide the problem toward something realistic and relevant to industry. Writing the problem statement and integrating literature strengthened the project’s scientific foundation.

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

I initially struggled with narrowing the scope — I had many ideas but needed to understand what was feasible within ELO2. I will work on breaking down tasks more systematically for Milestone 2.

## **Salih Adam — Individual Reflection**

### 🧠 Key Learnings

I learned the importance of evaluating feasibility when defining a data science problem. The domain was new to me, but reviewing geochemical papers helped me understand how elemental patterns relate to gold systems.

### ✅ Achievements

The meetings were productive, and we were able to clearly outline stakeholders, constraints, and research questions. I contributed to building the stakeholder map and organizing literature, which made the milestone more structured.

### ⚠️ Improvements for Next Milestone

Time management was occasionally a challenge, especially when reviewing long research papers. I plan to improve my consistency in asynchronous updates on GitHub to maintain alignment.
