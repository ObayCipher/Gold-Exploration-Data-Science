# Milestone 5 Retrospective

**Project:** Gold Pathfinder ML – Shamkya  
**Program:** MIT Emerging Talent – ELO2  
**Milestone:** 5 – Communicating Results  
**Period:** 23 Nov – 04 Dec 2025  

---

## ✅ What Went Well

- The presentation successfully distilled complex geochemical analysis into a clear, intuitive narrative.  
- Visuals such as the 2D Au contour, 3D Au surface, and pathfinder ratio charts strongly enhanced communication.  
- Collaboration between Obay and Salih improved efficiency in reviewing and refining final materials.  
- The final slide deck aligns well with ELO2 expectations for clarity, insight, and storytelling.

## ⚠️ What Was Challenging

- Selecting a small subset of visuals from a large body of analysis required careful judgment.  
- Balancing geological accuracy with simplicity for non-technical audiences was not always easy.  
- Formatting and image-link consistency across multiple Markdown files required extra validation.  
- Time pressure increased near the submission deadline.

## 💡 What We Learned

- Communication is as critical as technical analysis in a data science project.  
- Strong visuals can reveal patterns more effectively than text or tables alone.  
- A well-organized repository accelerates final assembly of deliverables.  
- Audience-focused storytelling helps bridge geology and data science.

## 🔄 What We’ll Improve Next Time

- Begin drafting communication artifacts earlier in the project.  
- Adopt predefined templates for ReadMe, posters, and presentations.  
- Automate figure exports to standardize format and resolution.  
- Conduct more dry-runs of the presentation to refine timing and clarity.

## 🎯 Strategy vs. Plan

### What went according to plan?

- Milestone 5 deliverables matched the intended timeline.  
- Poster, slide deck, and executive summary were completed on schedule.  
- Repository cleanup and tagging followed the ELO2 structure successfully.

### What deviated from the plan?

- Some visualization files required reorganization due to path issues.  
- Additional refinement of speaker notes was needed after slide deck updates.

## 👤 Individual Reflections

### **Obay Salih**

- This milestone strengthened my ability to turn complex geoscientific data into a compelling narrative.  
- The process improved my communication confidence, especially with interdisciplinary audiences.  
- Next time, I will prepare communication materials iteratively instead of all at the end.

### **Salih Adam**

- I learned how powerful visualization can be in simplifying geochemical complexity.  
- Reviewing visuals and slide transitions helped reinforce my understanding of the overall workflow.  
- In the future, I want to contribute earlier in drafting the communication artifact.

## 🏁 Final Notes

Milestone 5 successfully concludes the analytical and communication components of the ELO2 project.  
The final artifact provides a clear, research-backed foundation for future exploration or machine learning follow-up work.
