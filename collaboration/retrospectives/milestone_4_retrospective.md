# 🧠 **Milestone 4 – Retrospective**

**Project:** Gold Pathfinder ML – Shamkya  
**Program:** MIT Emerging Talent – ELO2  
**Period:** 09 Nov – 22 Nov 2025

---

## ✅ **What Went Well**

* The team successfully transformed complex geochemical analysis into **clear, stakeholder-friendly communication materials**.
* Visuals such as the **2D gold contour**, **3D gold surface**, and **Sb/As vectoring diagrams** were effectively integrated into the communication artifact.
* The message of the project—*“pathfinders help reveal what gold alone cannot”*—became more refined and easier to communicate.
* Collaboration worked smoothly: tasks were clearly divided, and updates were consistent.
* The team achieved strong alignment between **scientific analysis** and **storytelling**, which is the purpose of Milestone 4.

---

## ⚠️ **What Was Challenging**

* Selecting which plots to include required multiple iterations, as many figures were useful but not all supported a clean narrative.
* Translating technical results (ratios, clustering, nugget effect) into **non-technical language** was more difficult than expected.
* Ensuring that all visualizations displayed correctly across devices and GitHub formatting took extra time.
* It was sometimes challenging to balance detail and simplicity—especially when explaining vectoring concepts.

---

## 💡 **What We Learned**

* Effective scientific communication requires **simplicity, clarity, and intentional structure**, not just technical accuracy.
* Visuals must be chosen based on *story impact*, not quantity.
* Strong communication depends on framing: starting with the problem, then the data, then the insight, then the impact.
* The best communication artifacts explain **why the work matters**, not just what was done.

---

## 🔄 **What We’ll Improve Next**

* Spend more time early in analysis shaping the eventual story to simplify Milestone 4.
* Use a communication template earlier to plan slides and written narrative.
* Establish a “visual style guide” (colors, fonts, labeling) for more consistent visuals.
* Improve accessibility of graphics (short labels, annotated plots).

---

## 🎯 **Strategy vs. Execution**

### ✔️ What matched the plan

* Core visualizations were completed before communication drafting.
* The artifact followed the milestone expectations: **problem → method → results → impact**.
* Roles were clear:

  * Obay handled technical-to-narrative translation,
  * Salih supported figure selection and clarity review.

### ⚠️ What did not match the plan

* Some figures required regeneration due to formatting or readability issues.
* More time than planned was spent adjusting figure paths and preparing GitHub-safe versions.

### ➕ Additions that were not in the original plan

* Integrated interactive HTML 3D plots for the appendix.
* Added additional annotations to explain nugget effect and clustering.

### ➖ Steps we minimized or removed

* Reduced the number of correlation figures to keep the message focused.
* Removed dense numeric tables from the main artifact and placed them in the appendix.

## 👥 **Individual Reflections**

## **Obay Salih**

### 🧠 What You Learned

Milestone 4 was a deep exercise in **scientific storytelling**. I learned how important it is to translate technical insights into a simple narrative that non-technical stakeholders can understand. I also learned how powerful good visual design can be—especially when working with geochemical data that is naturally complex.

### ✅ What Went Well

* I was able to connect analytical results to meaningful exploration insights.
* My skills in structuring communication artifacts improved significantly.
* Integrating visuals into a coherent story felt natural once the structure was in place.

### ⚠️ What Could Be Improved

* I want to communicate more concisely—some early drafts were too technical.
* I need to plan visuals earlier so I can avoid reworking them later.
* I should standardize visual style across the project platform.

## **Salih Adam**

### **🧠 What You Learned**

I learned how to refine technical results into a narrative that is easy for stakeholders to follow. Milestone 4 helped me better understand how to translate data analysis into **decision-focused insights**.

### **✅ What Went Well**

* Worked effectively on reviewing narrative flow and plot readability.
* Provided feedback that improved clarity for non-technical readers.
* Helped ensure the communication artifact used clean, easy-to-understand graphics.

### **⚠️ What Could Be Improved**

* I aim to build stronger confidence in interpreting some of the geochemical figures.
* I need to participate earlier in the drafting process rather than later in polishing.
* I want to improve consistency when evaluating which visuals support the core message.

## 📘 **Overall Reflection**

Milestone 4 deepened both team members’ understanding of **how to communicate complex scientific findings clearly and persuasively**. The skills developed here will directly support the final milestone—**Milestone 5: Final Presentation**, where distilled communication becomes essential.
