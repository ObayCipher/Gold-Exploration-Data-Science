# 🗣️Communication Plan

This communication plan outlines how the team will coordinate, communicate, and manage deliverables while accounting for restricted internet access and platform limitations. It reflects the realities of working between China and Sudan while remaining aligned with ELO2 expectations.

---

## 📡 Communication Channels

## 💬 1. WhatsApp (Primary Communication Channel)

Used for:

- Daily check-ins and quick questions  
- Sharing text, screenshots, or short updates  
- Notifying teammates when files are ready or tasks are completed  

Why:

- Most reliable for both members
- Works even with unstable networks  
- Accessible in both China (with VPN) and Sudan  

Expected response time:

- 12–24 hours (as connectivity allows)

---

## 🎥 2. Google Meet (Meeting Platform)

Used for:

- Weekly or biweekly video meetings  
- Reviewing milestone progress  
- Discussing blockers or assigning new tasks  

Notes:

- Meetings may need flexible timing due to unstable connections  
- If video is not possible, voice or text fallback is allowed  

---

## ✉️ 3. Gmail (Backup Communication & File Transfer)

Used for:

- Sending larger files when GitHub is inaccessible  
- Notifications during long connectivity gaps  
- Backup for milestone submission drafts  

---

## 🐙 GitHub Usage Strategy (China/Sudan Access Limitations)

## ⚠️ Access Restrictions

- **GitHub is blocked in China**, and VPN reliability is inconsistent  
- **Sudan has frequent long-term internet outages**  
- Real-time collaboration on GitHub is not always possible  

## ✔️ Compliance Strategy (“Delayed Sync Workflow”)

To remain aligned with ELO2 requirements:

### 1. Work is completed **locally first**

- Code, notebooks, documentation, and edits are saved offline  
- Folder structure mirrors the GitHub repository  

### 2. When GitHub access becomes available

- Changes are uploaded in batches  
- Commits include clear messages explaining delays (e.g., *“Sync after network restoration”*)  
- Pull Requests are opened once connectivity stabilizes  

### 3. When GitHub is not available

- Files are exchanged through **WhatsApp, Gmail, or ZIP archives**  
- The receiving member merges the changes locally  
- Sync to GitHub is done once access is restored  

This ensures:

- Compliance with ET’s requirement to use GitHub  
- Honest accommodation of unavoidable internet restrictions  

---

## 📅 Meeting Structure

## 🧭 Frequency

- **Minimum once per week** (Google Meet or WhatsApp call)  
- Additional sessions during milestone deadlines  

## 📝 Documentation

All meetings include:

- Agenda (prepared beforehand)  
- Summary notes  
- Decisions made  
- Assigned tasks  

Stored as:

```text
/collaboration/meeting_01.md
/collaboration/meeting_02.md
```

---

## 🕒 Response Times

- WhatsApp: 12–24 hours  
- Gmail: 24–48 hours  
- GitHub PR reviews: when access allows, usually within 3–5 days  

Delays are expected due to connectivity issues and will be communicated.

---

## ⚠️ Handling Disruptions

### Examples

- China’s internet restrictions  
- Power cuts in Sudan  
- Long periods without network access  

### Protocol

1. Notify the team via WhatsApp (if possible).  
2. Continue work offline whenever possible.  
3. Share updated files through alternative channels (Gmail/WhatsApp).  
4. Sync to GitHub when access returns.  

---

## 🤝 Conflict Resolution

1. Discuss the issue using WhatsApp or Google Meet  
2. Allow each member to explain their perspective  
3. Refer to **Group Norms** for expected behavior  
4. If unresolved, escalate through MIT ET support channels  

---

## ✔️ Summary

This communication plan enables the team to collaborate effectively despite:

- Regional internet restrictions  
- Platform access limitations  
- Unpredictable connectivity  

By combining WhatsApp, Google Meet, Gmail, and a **delayed GitHub sync workflow**, we ensure:

- Smooth coordination  
- Continuous progress  
- Compliance with MIT ELO2 requirements  

It supports efficient teamwork and keeps all members aligned as we progress through the ELO2 milestones.
