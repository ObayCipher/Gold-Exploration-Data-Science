## 📝 1. Meeting Purpose

The purpose of this meeting was to:

* Review the **Milestone 3 final outputs**
* Decide how to translate technical findings into **simple stakeholder language**
* Select visualizations for the communication artifact
* Assign responsibilities and deadlines for Milestone 4

---

## 📊 2. Summary of Insights Reviewed

Key insights discussed:

* Gold distribution is **highly skewed** due to nugget effect.
* **Sb and Ag** show meaningful relationships with gold.
* **Zn** increases outward, marking a distal zone.
* **Sb/As ratio** is the strongest vectoring tool in the dataset.
* Spatial analysis highlights a **central–eastern mineralized hotspot**.
* Clustering confirms a **core → transition → distal** pattern.

These insights form the backbone of the stakeholder communication material.

---

## 🖼️ 3. Selected Figures for Milestone 4

The following visuals will be included:

* **2D Gold Contour Map**
* **3D Gold Surface Plot**
* **Cluster Map (k=3)**
* **Sb/As vs Au scatter plot**
* Optional: **interactive 3D HTML visualizations**

These will be added to both the communication artifact and the final presentation.

## 📌 6. Decisions Made

* Primary messaging will emphasize **clarity** and **practical exploration meaning**.
* The **Sb/As ratio** will be central to the narrative, as it’s the most reliable vectoring indicator.
* Uncertainties (nugget effect, missing Hg assays) **must be explicitly communicated**.
* The report will follow a storytelling structure:
  **Problem → Evidence → Interpretation → Recommendation**
