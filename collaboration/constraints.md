# ⚠️ Project Constraints

Project constraints define the boundaries within which this project must operate. They help the team make realistic plans, anticipate risks, and maintain a healthy workflow. These constraints are grouped into **external**, **internal involuntary**, and **internal voluntary** categories.

---

## 🔗 External Constraints  

External constraints are factors **outside the team’s direct control** but must be respected throughout the project.

### ⏳ Fixed Deadlines and Schedule

- All ELO2 milestone deadlines are non-negotiable.  
- Work must be planned with time buffers for revisions, testing, and unexpected delays.  
- Late submissions affect milestone reviews and overall progress.

### 🌐 Unpredictable Disruptions

- Internet outages, hardware failures, or power interruptions may impact work.  
- Members should proactively save progress and communicate if disruptions occur.

### 💾 Mandatory GitHub Usage

- GitHub is the **single source of truth** for code, data, and documents.  
- All final work must be versioned and stored in the repository.  
- Offline-only work is not permitted unless later synced to GitHub.

### 📊 Data Access & Permissions

- Only datasets with confirmed access rights may be used.  
- Some public data may have licenses or usage restrictions.  
- Data sources must be documented clearly in the repository.

## 🔐 Internal (Involuntary) Constraints

These arise from within the team but are **not intentionally created**.

### 🧠 Skill Level Differences

- Team members may vary in their familiarity with Python, GitHub, or data analysis.  
- Tasks may require collaborative learning or extra time to complete.

### 🕰️ Availability Conflicts

- Members may balance work, studies, or family responsibilities.  
- Scheduling must accommodate limited or shifting availability.

### 🚨 Personal Interruptions

- Illness, emergencies, or unforeseen personal events may impact workflow.  
- Members should communicate promptly so tasks can be reassigned if needed.

## 🧭 Internal (Voluntary) Constraints

These are **intentional boundaries** the team sets to maintain quality and collaboration.

### 🙋 Task Distribution by Preference

- Members may choose tasks aligned with their interests or growth goals.  
- Cross-learning is encouraged; teammates should help each other when needed.

### 📝 Documentation Standards

- Code must be commented clearly and include docstrings for major functions.  
- Datasets require a data dictionary and description of transformations.  
- Analysis notebooks must explain assumptions, methods, and conclusions.

### ✅ Review and Merge Protocol

- No code may be merged into the main branch without a review.  
- PR reviews ensure accuracy, readability, and reproducibility.  
- The team uses a shared review checklist before merging.

---

## 🔁 GitHub & Version Control Constraints

To maintain clean, traceable progress:

- Commit frequently with descriptive messages.  
- Use **feature branches** for each task (e.g., `feature-data-cleaning`).  
- Every merge requires a **pull request** (PR).  
- Branch names must be descriptive and relevant to the task.  
- Avoid pushing directly to the main branch.

These constraints support productive teamwork, high-quality deliverables, and smooth progress throughout all ELO2 milestones.
