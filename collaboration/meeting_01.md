## 📝 Key Points

### 1. Project Direction

- Focus on geochemical assay data for gold pathfinder identification.  
- Python will be used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

### 2. Communication Workflow

- WhatsApp: primary channel for daily coordination.  
- Google Meet: weekly/biweekly meetings.  
- Gmail: fallback for file transfer and notifications.  
- GitHub: used for version control through a **delayed sync workflow** due to internet restrictions in China and Sudan.

### 3. Constraints

- GitHub access blocked or unstable.  
- Frequent Sudan internet/power interruptions.  
- Offline work is required; syncing occurs when access permits.

### 4. Repository Structure

Approved folders include:  
`0_domain_study/`, `1_datasets/`, `2_data_preparation/`, `3_data_exploration/`,  
`4_data_analysis/`, `5_communication_strategy/`, `6_final_presentation/`, `collaboration/`,  
plus `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `LICENSE`.

### 5. Tasks

- **Obay:** README setup, communication plan, initial data setup, CONTRIBUTING.md.  
- **Salih:** Group norms and milestone reflection.  
- **Both:** Upload milestone documents and ensure folder structure is correct.

## 🚀 Next Steps
