# Collaboration Guide

## Group Norms

### 💠 Our Shared Purpose

Our group aims to create an environment where everyone feels respected, safe, and supported. We work together with honesty, empathy, and openness, valuing diverse ideas and building trust through consistent collaboration. Our goal is to do our best individually and collectively.

### 🗣️ Communication & Respect

- We communicate with kindness and listen attentively.  
- Every voice matters — ideas are judged by their quality, not by who shares them.  
- Questions are always welcome; everyone is free to express their views without fear of judgment.  
- Disagreements are natural; we address issues, not individuals.  
- We engage in open dialogue rooted in curiosity, understanding, and respect.

### 🔍 Constructive Discussions & Debate

- We begin discussions with clear goals and shared expectations.  
- All perspectives are welcome, including those that differ from our own.  
- Debates are collaborative — not competitive — and help us explore ideas more deeply.  
- If a decision cannot be reached, we will use a vote or seek guidance from a neutral member.  
- We maintain a positive, growth-minded attitude throughout discussions.  
- Code reviews and project feedback focus on the work itself, not the person behind it.  
- Feedback is constructive, respectful, and aimed at improving the final outcome.

### 🤝 Trust & Team Connection

- We assume positive intent — everyone is here to contribute and learn.  
- Mistakes are treated as opportunities for growth, not judgment.
